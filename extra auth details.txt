I. Core Authentication System Enhancements:
   1. JWT Generation & Verification: Replace dummy tokens with real JWTs (access/refresh), define        
      SECRET_KEY, and implement get_current_user for verification.
   2. Refresh Token Rotation: Securely manage and rotate refresh tokens, using HTTP-only cookies.        
   3. Rate Limiting: Implement slowapi to protect auth endpoints from brute-force attacks.
   4. Protected Routes: Apply get_current_user to secure API endpoints.

  II. Security & Robustness Improvements:
   5. Input Validation: Strengthen Pydantic models for password complexity and email format.
   6. Error Handling & Logging: Improve granular error handling and comprehensive logging for auth       
      events.
   7. CORS Refinement: Restrict allow_origins in production.
   8. Password Reset: Implement a secure password reset flow.
   9. Account Verification: Consider email verification for new registrations.

  III. Frontend Integration:
   10. AuthContext Update: Modify AuthContext.jsx to handle JWTs, refresh tokens, and logout.
   11. Axios Interceptor: Implement an Axios interceptor for automatic token attachment and 401
       handling.
   12. Protected Frontend Routes: Enhance ProtectedRoute.jsx for token validation.

  IV. Deployment & Operations:
   13. Production Database: Consider PostgreSQL for production scalability.
   14. Environment Variables: Ensure all sensitive configs are loaded from .env.
   15. Testing: Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and security tests.
