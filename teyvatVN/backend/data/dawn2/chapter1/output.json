A gentle breeze whispers through the trees surrounding the plaza, carrying the scent of pine and distant flowers. The city of Mondstadt twinkles below, a peaceful beacon in the growing twilight. It's a place of quiet reflection, where the Anemo Archon's silent gaze seems to encompass all of time.",
