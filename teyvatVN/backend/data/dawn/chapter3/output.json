The last echoes of the Windblume Festival's joyous cacophony have faded, leaving behind only the soft hum of the night and the clinking of bottles. Only a few patrons linger, nursing their final drinks, while the distant, faint sounds of Mondstadt's late-night revelry occasionally drift through the open door, a testament to the city's festive spirit.",
