Only a few patrons remain, huddled at the bar, casting nervous glances towards a secluded table. There, under the dim glow of a single lantern, Diluc Ragnvindr and Kaeya Alberich sit opposite each other, two brothers separated by more than just a table. The air itself feels charged, thick with unspoken words and the ghost of a shared, fractured past.",

The quiet patrons stare, now openly watching the silent, explosive confrontation unfold between the two brothers, a wound reopened, bleeding old, forgotten secrets into the hushed night."
