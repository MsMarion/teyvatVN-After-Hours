At the foot of the magnificent Anemo God's statue, two figures stood in quiet contemplation: Diluc Ragnvindr, the Wine Tycoon, and Jean Gunnhildr, the Acting Grand Master. A cool breeze carried the scent of cecilias from Starfell Lake, a stark contrast to the heavy silence between them.",

He stood there, a formidable silhouette against the fading light, his gaze fixed on the eternal symbol of freedom, perhaps finding a quiet solace in its unyielding presence, and in the shared, unspoken burdens with the woman beside him."
