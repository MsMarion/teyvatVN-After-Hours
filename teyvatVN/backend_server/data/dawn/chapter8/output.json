Dust motes dance in the amber glow of the lamps, casting long, wavering shadows across the polished wooden tables. The air is thick with the scent of dandelion wine and aged oak, a comforting hush settling over the otherwise lively establishment.",

Jean watches him for another moment, a gentle, knowing expression on her face, before she too turns back to the hearth, the quiet memories of the evening settling around them both like a comforting, bittersweet shroud."
