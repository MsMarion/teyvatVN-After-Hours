A gentle Anemo breeze rustles through the grass, carrying with it the scent of wild cecilias. Jean, the Acting Grand Master, stands with her back to the city, her gaze fixed on the distant horizon. Diluc, Master of the Dawn Winery, stands a short distance away, his arms crossed, his usual stern expression softened slightly by the tranquil evening.",
