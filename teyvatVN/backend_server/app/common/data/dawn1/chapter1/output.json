At the base of the Statue of the Seven, where the Anemo Archon's silent gaze watches over the city, Diluc Ragnvindr stands, his back to the city. The wind whispers through the trees, carrying the faint scent of cecilias. A moment later, Kaeya Alberich arrives, his steps light, breaking the serene silence.",
